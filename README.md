# Azure: Infrastructure as Code
Test repo to track progress of getting comfortable with using devops principles with Azure

This is a personal repo to help me keep track of the timeline of my experiments using Microsoft Azure.

A lot of the code from here as of the first few commits is boilerplate taken from other Terraform tutorials.

## Notes
`terraform plan` will run through what is to be done;
`terraform apply` will actually do it.

Deleting infrastructure can be done with `terraform destroy`, but only if the terraform template files are valid.
