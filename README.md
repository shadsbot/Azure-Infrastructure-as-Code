# Azure: Infrastructure as Code
Test repo to track progress of getting comfortable with using devops principles with Azure

This is a personal repo to help me keep track of the timeline of my experiments using Microsoft Azure.

A lot of the code from here as of the first few commits is boilerplate taken from other Terraform tutorials.
